I'm the creator of project 
[Cubecraft]([https://github.com/FlybirdGameStudio/Cubecraft](https://github.com/CubecraftDevelopment/Cubecraft))

I've been exploring the world of programming since the age of 13, starting with Java. 
Over the years, I've expanded my skills to include Python, and I'm currently diving into C# and C++.
I'm passionate about developing user-friendly applications, 
and I have experience working with JavaFX and am currently learning Avalonia for cross-platform development.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects to see what I've been working on. 
Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions!
